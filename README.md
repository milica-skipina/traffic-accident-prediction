# Traffic Accident Severity Prediction in the City of New York


This repository contains the source code for project done as the part of the Data Mining and Data Analysis Systems course at master's academic studies in Computing and Control Engineering, Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad. 

We propose a solution that leverages open datasets of a city like New York City, in order to create reliable, explainable and efficient machine learning accident severity prediction models.

We present a dataset, which was obtained by extracting accident, weather, road and traffic related information from various data sources as well as a preprocessing pipeline which accounts for severe class imbalance related to accident severity prediction problem.

Our approaches and results are described [here](https://github.com/milica-skipina/traffic-accident-prediction/blob/main/SIAP_Skipina_Batic.pdf).
