# Traffic Accident Severity Prediction in the City of New York


This repository contains the source code for project done as the part of the Data Mining and Data Analysis Systems course at master's academic studies in Computing and Control Engineering, Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad. 


We applied various ML algorithms to predict the risk, and later classify the severity of traffic accidents in New York City. Our approaches and result are described [here](https://github.com/milica-skipina/traffic-accident-prediction/blob/main/SIAP_Skipina_Batic.pdf).
